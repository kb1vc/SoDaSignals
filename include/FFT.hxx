     * @brief constructor
     * 
     * Build an object that can produce DFT/IDFT for complex vectors 
     * of a particular size.  By constructing an FFT object to be applied
     * to multiple vectors, we save the initialization and measurement
     * costs associated with FFTW's run-time optimization. 
     * 
     * There are special configurations for polyphase schemes. To build a polyphase 
     * interpolator, upsampling by U, create two FFT objects:
     * 
     * FFT(N, ..., 1, 1) for the input transform to create an N element FFT x -> X
     *
     * then multiply X by the U filters to create U vectors of N/U length
     * FFT(N/U, ..., U, U) 
     * Apply IFFT to the Y vector to get the upsampled result. 
     *
     * For a polyphase decimator by downsampling rate D, 
     * 
     * FFT(N/D, ..., D, D) x[...D] -> X[...D]
     * Multiply the D X[] by the D filters (this is really a contiguous vector-vector point-by-point mul)
     * invert D,D -> V[...D] to get v[...D]
     * SUM V[n * D .. n * (D-1] to get Y[n]
     *  
     * @param N the number of elements in an input vector passed to fft or ifft
     * @param flags FFTW optimization flags.  FFTW_UNALIGNED is, unless the user
     * knows better, all-but-mandatory.  FFTW_ESTIMATE provides reasonable performance
     * for modern X86 processors, and is sufficiently close to the result from 
     * FFTW_MEASURE as to be "just fine."
     * @param istride if not 1, process [istride] interleaved vectors on the input
     * read the mth input vector at inbuf[k * istride + m]
     * @param ostride if not 1, produce the mth output vector at outbuf[k * ostride + m]
